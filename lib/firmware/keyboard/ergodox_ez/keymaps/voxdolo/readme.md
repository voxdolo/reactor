# The voxdolo-friendly version of the default firmware

This is pretty close to the layout I was using on my Ergodox Infinity. It's
tooled with an eye toward editing lisps in Emacs Evil-mode and with a handful of
very me-specific worfkflow keys (like my sizeup bindings and some media keys on
layer 0).
